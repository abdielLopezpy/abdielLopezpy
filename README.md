**Software Architect | CRDTs | Local-First | Edge Computing | Microservices | IoT**

I build resilient, offline-capable distributed systems that put data ownership back in the user's hands. My work focuses on Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs), local-first architectures, edge computing, microservices, and IoT systems that eliminate single points of failure and scale from the cloud to the smallest device.

---

## What I Do

- **CRDT Implementation** — Designing and implementing conflict-free replicated data types for real-time collaborative applications. From operational transforms to state-based and delta-state CRDTs, I focus on convergence guarantees without coordination overhead.

- **Local-First Architecture** — Building applications where data lives on the device first. Users get instant responses, full offline capability, and seamless sync when connectivity returns. No server dependency, no data loss.

- **Edge Computing** — Pushing computation to the edge to reduce latency, improve privacy, and enable true peer-to-peer collaboration. Architecting systems where nodes are autonomous yet eventually consistent.

- **Microservices Architecture** — Designing domain-driven, loosely coupled services that scale independently. API gateways, service meshes, event-driven communication, and observability patterns for systems that grow without breaking.

- **IoT & Embedded Systems** — Connecting the physical and digital world. MQTT/CoAP protocols, sensor data pipelines, device fleet management, and edge-to-cloud architectures for smart devices that operate reliably in constrained environments.

- **Open Source Contributor** — I actively contribute to the open source ecosystem, building tools and libraries that advance local-first and distributed systems for the community.
